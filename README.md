## Project Structure

```
nextjs-infinite-scroll-gallery/
â”œâ”€â”€ app/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layout.tsx            # Root layout with metadata and global styles
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ page.tsx              # Home page with the gallery
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ globals.css           # Global styles
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Gallery.tsx           # Gallery component with infinite scroll logic
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ImageCard.tsx         # Image card component with animations
â”œâ”€â”€ actions/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ getImages.ts          # Server action to fetch images
â”œâ”€â”€ types/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Image.ts              # Type definitions for image data
â”œâ”€â”€ public/                   # Static assets (e.g., favicon)
â””â”€â”€ package.json              # Project dependencies
```

## How It Works

1. **Fetching Images**:
   - The `getImages` server action fetches images from the [Picsum Photos API](https://picsum.photos/).
   - The initial set of images is fetched on the server side and passed to the `Gallery` component.

2. **Infinite Scroll**:
   - The `Gallery` component uses the `useInView` hook from **React Intersection Observer** to detect when the user scrolls to the bottom of the page.
   - When the bottom is reached, more images are fetched and appended to the existing list.

3. **Animations**:
   - The `ImageCard` component uses **Framer Motion** to animate images as they come into view.

4. **SEO Optimization**:
   - The `layout.tsx` file includes metadata for better SEO and social media sharing.

## Customization

### Change the API
To use a different API, update the `getImages` function in `actions/getImages.ts`:

```typescript
const url = `https://your-api.com/endpoint?page=${offset}&limit=${limit}`;
```

### Add More Animations
Use **Framer Motion** to add more animations to the `ImageCard` component:

```tsx
<motion.div
  initial={{ opacity: 0, scale: 0.9 }}
  whileInView={{ opacity: 1, scale: 1 }}
  transition={{ duration: 0.5 }}
>
  {/* Image content */}
</motion.div>
```

### Update Metadata
Edit the `metadata` object in `app/layout.tsx` to include your site's information:

```typescript
export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: 'Your Site Title',
  description: 'Your site description.',
  openGraph: {
    title: 'Your Site Title',
    description: 'Your site description.',
    images: [
      {
        url: 'https://yourwebsite.com/og-image.jpg',
        width: 1200,
        height: 630,
        alt: 'Your Site Title',
      },
    ],
  },
};
```
